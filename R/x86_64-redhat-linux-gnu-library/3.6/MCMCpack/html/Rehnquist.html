<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataframe contains a matrix of votes cast by U.S. Supreme Court
justices by all cases in the 1994-2004 terms.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The dataframe has contains data for justices Rehnquist, Stevens,
O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Breyer for the
1994-2004 terms of the U.S. Supreme Court.  The dataframe also contains the

votes are coded liberal (1) and conservative (0) using the protocol of
Spaeth (2003).  The unit of analysis is the case citation (ANALU=0).  We are
