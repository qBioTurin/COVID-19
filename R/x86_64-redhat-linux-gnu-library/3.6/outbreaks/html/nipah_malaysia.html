<p>Nipah virus is a paramyxovirus that occurs in flying fox (fruit bat) populations
throughout Asia. The data provided are from the first known emergence of Nipah
virus into humans. During this outbreak, the virus was transmitted from bats to
pigs, where it circulated in commercial pig farms, infecting mostly farm and
abbatoir workers. The outbreak started in Perak State, later spreading
to Negeri Sembilan and Seleangor through sale of infected pigs. There were
also 11 cases reported among abbatoir workers in Singapor. The data, as published
in Pulliam _et al_. (2011), include all 257 clinical cases recorded in humans from
1997-01-11 to 1999-04-14, when the outbreak ended following large-scale
depopulation of pig farms. Human cases represent zoonotic infections, with little
or no human-to-human transmission. Thus, the epidemic curve reflects transmission
and spatial spread within pigs.
