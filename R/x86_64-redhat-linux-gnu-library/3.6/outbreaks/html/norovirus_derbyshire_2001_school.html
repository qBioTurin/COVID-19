<p>The data on norovirus cases were analysed by O'Neill and Marks (2005). As described in the paper, out of a
total of 492 children in the school, 186 were absent from school with gastrointestinal symptoms.
The school was cleaned on days 13 and 14, and on days 20 and 21, both of which were weekends,
and the school was shut on days 18 and 19. Following the second cleaning, there were no further
absences, although three children reported symptoms on day 22, the last day of the outbreak.
