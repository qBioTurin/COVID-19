EMforCFR                A function to estimate the relative case
                        fatality ratio when reporting rates are
                        time-varying and deaths are lagged because of
                        survival time.

                        object
dgammaOff1              Function that calculates dgamma with a offset
                        of 1 (i.e., 1 is equivalent to 0)
dic.fit                 censored survival data
dic.fit.mcmc            Fits the distribution to the passed-in data
                        using MCMC as implemented in MCMCpack.

logLik,cd.fit-method    Get the log-likelihood value of a 'cd.fit' or
                        'cd.fit.mcmc' object
loglikhd                Negative log likelihood for a dataset of
                        interval-censored data, given a distribution
                        and its parameters.

                        of 1 (i.e., 1 is equivalent to 0)
plot,cd.fit-method      Plots the estimated survival function with an
                        option to plot the posterior draws or
                        bootstraps behind the fit
precision.simulation    Simulate incubation period analyses with coarse
                        data
