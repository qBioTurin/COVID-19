<h2>Convert week numbers to dates or aweek objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are vectorized functions that take integer vectors and return Date or
an aweek objects, making it easier to convert bare weeks to dates.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
get_aweek(
  week = 1L,
  year = format(Sys.Date(), "%Y"),
  day = 1L,
  start = week_start,
  week_start = get_week_start(),
  ...
)

get_date(
  week = 1L,
  year = format(Sys.Date(), "%Y"),
  day = 1L,
  start = get_week_start()
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>week</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer vector, defaults to 1, representing the first week of the year.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>year</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer vector, defaults to the current year</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>day</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer vector, defaults to 1, representing the first day of
the first week of the year.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>start</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer (or character) vector of days that the weeks
start on for each corresponding week. Defaults to the value of
<code><a href="week_start.html">get_week_start()</a></code>. Note that these will not determine the final week.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>week_start</code></td>
<td>
<p>a number indicating the start of the week based on the ISO
8601 standard from 1 to 7 where 1 = Monday OR an abbreviation of the
weekdate in an English or current locale. <em>Note: using a non-English locale
may render your code non-portable.</em> Defaults to the value of
<code><a href="week_start.html">get_week_start()</a></code></p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>parameters passed on to <code><a href="date2week.html">date2week()</a></code></p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>


<ul>
<li><p> get_aweek(): an aweek object
</p>
</li>
<li><p> get_date(): a Date object
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Any missing weeks, years, or start elements will result in a
missing element in the resulting vector. Any missing days will
revert to the first day of the week.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>

# The default results in the first week of the year using the default
# default week_start (from get_week_start())

get_aweek()
get_date() # this is equivalent to as.Date(get_week()), but faster 

# Some years, like 2015, have 53 weeks

get_aweek(53, 2015)

# If you specify 53 weeks for a year that doesn't have 53 weeks, aweek will
# happily correct it for you

get_aweek(53, 2014) # this will be 2015-W01-1

# you can use this to quickly make a week without worrying about formatting
# here, you can define an observation interval of 20 weeks

obs_start &lt;- get_date(week = 10, year = 2018)
obs_end   &lt;- get_date(week = 29, year = 2018, day = 7)
c(obs_start, obs_end)

# If you have a data frame of weeks, you can use it to convert easily

mat &lt;- matrix(c(
  2019, 11, 1, 7, # 2019-03-10
  2019, 11, 2, 7,
  2019, 11, 3, 7,
  2019, 11, 4, 7,
  2019, 11, 5, 7,
  2019, 11, 6, 7,
  2019, 11, 7, 7
), ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)

colnames(mat) &lt;- c("year", "week", "day", "start")
m &lt;- as.data.frame(mat)
m
sun &lt;- with(m, get_date(week, year, day, start))
sun
as.aweek(sun) # convert to aweek starting on the global week_start 
as.aweek(sun, week_start = "Sunday") # convert to aweek starting on Sunday

# You can also change starts
mon &lt;- with(m, get_aweek(week, year, day, "Monday", week_start = "Monday"))
mon
as.Date(mon)

# If you use multiple week starts, it will convert to date and then to
# the correct week, so it won't appear to match up with the original
# data frame.

sft &lt;- with(m, get_aweek(week, year, day, 7:1, week_start = "Sunday"))
sft
as.Date(sft)
