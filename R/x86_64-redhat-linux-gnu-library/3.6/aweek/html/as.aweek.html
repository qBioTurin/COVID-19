<h2>Convert characters or dates to aweek objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Convert characters or dates to aweek objects
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
as.aweek(x, week_start = get_week_start(), ...)

## Default S3 method:
as.aweek(x, week_start = NULL, ...)

## S3 method for class ''NULL''
as.aweek(x, week_start = NULL, ...)

## S3 method for class 'character'
as.aweek(x, week_start = get_week_start(), start = week_start, ...)

## S3 method for class 'factor'
as.aweek(x, week_start = get_week_start(), ...)

## S3 method for class 'Date'
as.aweek(x, week_start = get_week_start(), ...)

## S3 method for class 'POSIXt'
as.aweek(x, week_start = get_week_start(), ...)

## S3 method for class 'aweek'
as.aweek(x, week_start = NULL, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a <a href="../../base/html/Dates.html">Date</a>, <a href="../../base/html/DateTimeClasses.html">POSIXct</a>, <a href="../../base/html/DateTimeClasses.html">POSIXlt</a>, or a
correctly formatted (YYYY-Www-d) character string that represents the year,
week, and weekday.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>week_start</code></td>
<td>
<p>a number indicating the start of the week based on the ISO
8601 standard from 1 to 7 where 1 = Monday OR an abbreviation of the
weekdate in an English or current locale. <em>Note: using a non-English locale
may render your code non-portable.</em> Defaults to the value of
<code><a href="week_start.html">get_week_start()</a></code></p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>arguments passed on to <code><a href="date2week.html">date2week()</a></code> and <code><a href="../../base/html/as.POSIXlt.html">as.POSIXlt()</a></code></p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>start</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer (or character) vector of days that the weeks
start on for each corresponding week. Defaults to the value of
<code><a href="week_start.html">get_week_start()</a></code>. Note that these will not determine the final week.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>as.aweek()</code> will coerce character, dates, and datetime objects
to aweek objects. Dates are trivial to convert to weeks because there is
only one correct way to convert them with any given <code>week_start</code>.
</p>
<p>There is a bit of nuance to be aware of when converting
characters to aweek objects:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> The characters must be correctly formatted as <code>YYYY-Www-d</code>, where YYYY
is the year relative to the week, Www is the week number (ww) prepended
by a W, and d (optional) is the day of the week from 1 to 7 where 1
represents the week_start. This means that characters formatted as
dates will be rejected.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> By default, the <code>week_start</code> and <code>start</code> parameters are identical. If
your data contains heterogeneous weeks (e.g. some dates will have the
week start on Monday and some will have the week start on Sunday), then
you should use the <code>start</code> parameter to reflect this. Internally, the
weeks will first be converted to dates with their respective starts and
then converted back to weeks, unified under the <code>week_start</code> parameter.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an <a href="aweek-class.html">aweek</a> object
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>factors are first converted to characters before they are converted to
aweek objects.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><a href="aweek-class.html">&quot;aweek-class&quot;</a> for details on the aweek object,
<code><a href="get_aweek.html">get_aweek()</a></code> for converting numeric weeks to weeks or dates,
<code><a href="date2week.html">date2week()</a></code> for converting dates to weeks, <code><a href="date2week.html">week2date()</a></code> for converting
weeks to dates.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>

# aweek objects can only be created from valid weeks:

as.aweek("2018-W10-5", week_start = 7) # works!
try(as.aweek("2018-10-5", week_start = 7)) # doesn't work :(

# you can also convert dates or datetimes
as.aweek(Sys.Date())
as.aweek(Sys.time())

# all functions get passed to date2week, so you can use any of its arguments:
as.aweek("2018-W10-5", week_start = 7, floor_day = TRUE, factor = TRUE) 
as.aweek(as.Date("2018-03-09"), floor_day = TRUE, factor = TRUE)

# If you have a character vector where different elements begin on different
# days of the week, you can use the "start" argument to ensure they are
# correctly converted.
as.aweek(c(mon = "2018-W10-1", tue = "2018-W10-1"), 
         week_start = "Monday", 
         start = c("Monday", "Tuesday"))

# you can convert aweek objects to aweek objects:
x &lt;- get_aweek()
as.aweek(x)
as.aweek(x, week_start = 7)
