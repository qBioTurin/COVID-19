# earlyR 0.0.1

This is the first release of the package

## New features

- `get_R`: a function to estimate *R* as well as the force of infection over
    time, from incidence data; output is an object of class `earlyR`

- `sample_R`: a function to obtain a sample of likely *R* values

- `plot`: a function to visualise `earlyR` objects (*R* or force of infection).

- `points`: a function using `earlyR` objects to add the force of infection
    to an existing plot.
